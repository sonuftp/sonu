    Introduction to Luminescence Lite
-------------------------------------------------------

(1) What's in the Download

When you unzip your download, you will find a few things to help you get setup.

   1. luminescence-lite.zip - this is your actual theme that you install
   2. child-theme - this is an installable theme so you can make modifications
   
(2)  Installing Your Theme
Installing Luminescence Lite will be just like any other theme by using the 
WordPress theme installer. You can also unzip the theme file and upload
the theme folder with its files into the /wp-content/themes/ folder.

(3) Making Theme Modificatons
WordPress recommends using a "child theme" whenever you want to make theme modifications 
to core theme files. This allows you to get theme updates whenever they come available 
without overwriting changes you might have made. This theme includes a child theme in your 
original download in a folder called child-theme.

To read more about child themes, please check out the WordPress Codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

(4) Theme Options
Luminescence Lite comes with the built-in WordPress Theme Customizer which lets
you make personalized changes to your theme layout, colours, and more.
To access the customizer, you can do it from the Dashboard main page
and clicking on the big button "Customize your Site", or from the 
Appearance >> Theme Options.

(5) Plugins (Optional)
When you look at the Luminescence Lite demo website http://demo.styledthemes.com/luminescence-lite/
you will find that that I am using a few plugins which are considered optional and not required but
recommended:

 (1) Contact Form 7 (free)
 (2) Dynamic Widgets (free)
 (3) Simply Exclude (free)
 (4) Remove Widget Title (free)
